<p>Do not power the phone on until you are finished signing up.</p>
<p>Once you have this information ready click “<a href="register.html" target="_blank">Join Us</a>” from our home page and follow the directions.

            <p>Joining is a simple and fast process.  Before you start make sure you have your phone’s MEID and ICCID.  Both of these numbers can be found on the box your phone came in.</p>
<p>You will also need to make sure you have your Phone number, account number (sometimes your account number is your phone number) and PIN of your current mobile provider.  If you don’t have that information you will need to contact your provider to get it.</p>
<p>Do not power the phone on until you get confirmation that your phone number has been transferred.</p>
<p>Once you have this information click “<a href="register.html" target="_blank">Join Us</a>” from our home page and follow the simple directions.  The registration process should only take a few minutes to complete but transferring your number will take a little bit longer.  Usually it only takes about 2 hours.  Mobile numbers though sometimes take up to 24 hours and landlines could take up to 7 days.</p>
<p>We will update you with the status of your activation if you provide us with an email address during registration or by following the on screen instructions at the completion of sign up.</p>
<p>While you are waiting for the phone number to be transferred your phone will not work.</p>

            <p>Bring any eligible Sprint® device to Boss Revolution Mobile.</p>
<p>Not all Sprint® devices are eligible for activation. Specific restrictions and exclusion apply. Some features of your Sprint® device may not function properly on Boss Revolution Mobile.</p>
<p>Boss Revolution Mobile services are provided on the Nationwide Sprint® Network. Boss Revolution Mobile is responsible for the service. Please call Boss Revolution Mobile with any questions or comments about the service.</p>
<p>Sprint® is a trademark of Sprint.</p>
<p>The following unlocked phones will work with Boss Revolution Mobile only if they are on Verizon:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone:</strong> 5C, 5S, 7, 7+</li>
</ul>
<p>The following unlocked phones will work with Boss Revolution Mobile regardless of what carrier they are on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nexus:</strong> 5X, 6, 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL</li>
<li><strong>iPhone:</strong> 6 and 6 Plus, 6S, 6S+, SE</li>

<li><strong>Samsung:</strong> Galaxy S7 Special Edition, Galaxy S7 Edge Special Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>If your phone was on a prepaid account and was purchased at either a large retailer or from your carrier directly it will usually need to be active for 12 consecutive months before becoming compatible with Boss Revolution Mobile.</p>
<p>If you purchase a phone from a third party and it fails to connect to our network contact the seller right away so that you can arrange for a refund.</p>
<p>If the phone belongs to you, you will need to contact your carrier to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Before you buy a phone make sure it’s coming from a trusted source. Any phones that have ever been classified as lost or stolen will not activate on Boss Revolution Mobile.</p>
<p>Depending on which Carrier network the phone was previously on you may need to purchase a new SIM card that is compatible with Boss Revolution. You can buy one in <a href="http://mobilestore.mvnodepot.com/phones" target="_blank">Boss Revolution Mobile Shop</a>.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The first step when signing up will be to check your phone’s eligibility to be used with Boss Revolution.  Before you start make sure you have your device’s MEID or IMEI.  If you have an LTE phone you will also need a SIM card number (ICCID) that is compatible with Boss Revolution.</p>
<p>The MEID/IMEI can be found by using any of the following methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter <kbd>*#06#</kbd> on your phone&#39;s dial pad</li>
<li>Check in the settings menu:<ul>
<li>Android: Go to Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Status</li>
<li>iPhone: Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; About</li>
<li>Windows Phone: Go to Settings &gt; About &gt; More info</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check under your device&#39;s battery. Note: It may be listed as “DEC” or “HEX”</li>
<li>Look for a sticker on the box your device came in.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ICCID can be found by any of the following methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check in the settings menu:<ul>
<li>iPhone:<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings.”</li>
<li>Select “General”</li>
<li>Select “About”<br>You can now see your ICCID listed in the About section.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Android phones may vary slightly. To retrieve your ICCID (SIM card number):<ol>
<li>Go to “Settings.”</li>
<li>Scroll down and select “About” or “About Phone” depending on the model you are using</li>
<li>Select “Status”</li>
<li>On some phones your ICCID will now be visible. On other phones select “IMEI Information” first.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can simply get the SIM card number by ejecting it from the SIM slot or by pulling it out from a tray on the phone. Androids can have different locations for the SIM card. Occasionally, a SIM tool or push pin may be required to open a SIM tray. If your phone has this design, simply put the tool or the push pin into the small hole located next to the tray and it should eject the SIM card</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s best to turn your device off during the registration process.</p>
<p>Once you have this information click “<a href="register.html" target="_blank">Join Us</a>” from our home page and follow the simple directions.

            <p>After your activation is complete, turn your phone off, then power your phone on. If it connects to the network, you are all set and ready to use Boss Revolution Mobile.</p>
<p>Depending on your phone you may need to use a Special Code To Reset the Network. (SCRTN). Don’t worry, an SCRTN, also known as a carrier wipe, will not erase any information from your phone.</p>
<p>Performing an SCRTN is easy and only takes a minute. Enter the appropriate code from the list below into your phone’s dialpad. The phone will reboot a couple of times as it resets to our network. These codes will be slightly different depending on your phone.</p>

        <div>
            <p>With Boss Revolution Mobile the <a href="index.html#rates-block" target="_blank">rates</a> are a simple.  There are no contracts, no tricks, no hidden fees or taxes.   You will pay for what you use, as you use it. $5 is deducted from your balance every 30 days.  Your 30 day cycle is based on the time that you signed up.  If you don’t have sufficient balance in your account you will be notified and placed into a 14 day grace period.   After the grace period is complete your account will be terminated and your phone number will be lost.</p>
<p>Airtime is a charge per minute for all phone calls made without the Boss Revolution app.  In other words, when calling with your Phone’s dialpad or contacts.   Airtime calls that connect are billed from the time that ringing starts.  Calls that don’t connect are not billed.  All calls made using the Boss Revolution mobile app are billed from the time of the connection.  There is no Airtime charge when dialing through the app. Use the Boss Revolution app to save on all of your calls.</p>
<p>All calls you receive including voicemail will use Airtime.</p>
<p>Data is billed in Megabyte increments.  In order to give you the best data experience, when you begin a data session we deduct enough balance to allow your data to stream continuously. When your data session ends whatever amount is unused gets returned to your balance.  That is why you sometimes will see your balance fluctuate slightly up or down, sometimes even after you have just recharged your account.  With Boss Revolution Mobile you will never pay for data that you don’t use.</p>
