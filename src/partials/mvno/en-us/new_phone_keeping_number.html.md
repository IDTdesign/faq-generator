Joining is a simple and fast process.  Before you start make sure you have your phone’s MEID and ICCID.  Both of these numbers can be found on the box your phone came in.

You will also need to make sure you have your Phone number, account number (sometimes your account number is your phone number) and PIN of your current mobile provider.  If you don’t have that information you will need to contact your provider to get it.

Do not power the phone on until you get confirmation that your phone number has been transferred.

Once you have this information click “<a href="register.html" target="_blank">Join Us</a>” from our home page and follow the simple directions.  The registration process should only take a few minutes to complete but transferring your number will take a little bit longer.  Usually it only takes about 2 hours.  Mobile numbers though sometimes take up to 24 hours and landlines could take up to 7 days.

We will update you with the status of your activation if you provide us with an email address during registration or by following the on screen instructions at the completion of sign up.

While you are waiting for the phone number to be transferred your phone will not work.
