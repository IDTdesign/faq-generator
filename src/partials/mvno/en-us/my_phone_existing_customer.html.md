If you are already a Boss Revolution Mobile customer and you want to switch to a new device, log into your account and use the Swap Device feature.  Just like when you signed up for our service make sure that before you start the Device Swap you have located the device’s MEID or IMEI.  If you have an LTE phone you will also need a SIM card number (ICCID) that is compatible with Boss Revolution.

Depending on which Carrier network the phone was previously on you may need to purchase a new SIM card that is compatible with Boss Revolution.  They are sold in <a href="http://mobilestore.mvnodepot.com/phones" target="\_blank">Boss Revolution Mobile Shop</a>.

The MEID or IMEI can be found by using any of the following methods

1. Enter <kbd>\*#06#</kbd> on your phone's dial pad
2. Check in the settings menu:
  * Android: Go to Settings > About Phone > Status
  * iPhone: Go to Settings > General > About
  * Windows Phone: Go to Settings > About > More info
3. Check under your device's battery. Note: It may be listed as “DEC” or “HEX”
4. Look for a sticker on the box your device came in.

The ICCID can be found by any of the following methods.

1. Check in the settings menu:
  * iPhone:
    1. Go to “Settings.”
    2. Select “General”
    3. Select “About”  
    You can now see your ICCID listed in the About section.
  * Android phones may vary slightly. To retrieve your ICCID (SIM card number):
    1. Go to “Settings.”
    2. Scroll down and select “About” or “About Phone” depending on the model you are using
    3. Select “Status”
    4. On some phones your ICCID will now be visible. On other phones select “IMEI Information” first.
2. You can simply get the SIM card number by ejecting it from the SIM slot or by pulling it out from a tray on the phone. Androids can have different locations for the SIM card. Occasionally, a SIM tool or push pin may be required to open a SIM tray. If your phone has this design, simply put the tool or the push pin into the small hole located next to the tray and it should eject the SIM card
