It’s best to connect to WiFi before backing up.

**Android**  
Though the specific procedure may slightly vary between Android devices, the process is generally the same.  In your phone’s Personal or General settings select back up &amp; reset.

**iPhone**

1. Go to Settings > [your name], and tap iCloud. If you’re using iOS 10.2 or earlier, go to Settings, then scroll down and tap iCloud.
2. Tap iCloud Backup. If you're using iOS 10.2 or earlier, tap Backup. Make sure that iCloud Backup is turned on.
3. Tap Back Up Now. Stay connected to your Wi-Fi network until the process completes.
4. Make sure that the backup finished: Go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Storage > Manage Storage, then select your device. If you’re using iOS 10.2 or earlier, go to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage, then select your device. The backup should appear in the details with the time and backup size.
