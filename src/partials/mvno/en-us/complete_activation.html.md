After your activation is complete, turn your phone off, then power your phone on. If it connects to the network, you are all set and ready to use Boss Revolution Mobile.

Depending on your phone you may need to use a Special Code To Reset the Network. (SCRTN). Don’t worry, an SCRTN, also known as a carrier wipe, will not erase any information from your phone.

Performing an SCRTN is easy and only takes a minute. Enter the appropriate code from the list below into your phone’s dialpad. The phone will reboot a couple of times as it resets to our network. These codes will be slightly different depending on your phone.
