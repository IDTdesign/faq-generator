Boss Revolution Mobile uses the Sprint® network.   Sprint® network phones will work with Boss Revolution Mobile as long as they pass a Sprint®  Financial Eligibility Check.  See below for more about the Financial Eligibility Check.

The following unlocked phones will work with Boss Revolution Mobile regardless of what carrier they are on:

* **Nexus:** 5X, 6, 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL
* **iPhone:** 6 and 6 Plus, 6S, 6S+, SE
* **Motorola:** Moto X Pure Edition, G4, G4 Plus, G4 Play, G5, G5 Plus
* **Samsung:** Galaxy S7 Special Edition, Galaxy S7 Edge Special Edition

The following unlocked phones will work with Boss Revolution Mobile only if they are on Sprint or Verizon:

* **iPhone:** 5C, 5S, 7, 7+

All other phones not listed above must be on the Sprint® network.  If you are buying a phone not listed above make sure you are buying a Sprint® network phone.

All phones must pass a Sprint Financial Eligibility Check.  This means that if the phone was previously on a postpaid account, the service agreement or the Early Termination Fee (ETF) must be paid first.

If the phone was on a prepaid account and was purchased at either a large retailer or from Sprint directly it will usually need to be active for 12 consecutive months before becoming compatible with Boss Revolution mobile.

If you purchase a phone from a third party and it fails financial eligibility check when you try to sign up, contact the seller right away so that you can arrange for a refund.

If the phone belongs to you, you will need to contact your carrier to resolve this issue.

Before you buy a phone make sure it’s coming from a trusted source.  Any phones that have ever been classified as lost or stolen will not activate on Boss Revolution Mobile.

Depending on which Carrier network the phone was previously on you may need to purchase a new SIM card that is compatible with Boss Revolution.  You can buy one in <a href="http://mobilestore.mvnodepot.com/phones" target="\_blank">Boss Revolution Mobile Shop</a>.
