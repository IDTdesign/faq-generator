If your device is lost or stolen call customer service immediately.  Customer Service will be able to suspend your account until you either find your device or get a new one.  When your account is suspended you will still have $5 deducted from it each month but this will make sure that your number stays with you and that no one will be able to use your balance for anything else until you get a new phone and activate it.
