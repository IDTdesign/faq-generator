With Boss Revolution Mobile the <a href="index.html#rates-block" target="_blank">rates</a> are a simple.  There are no contracts, no tricks, no hidden fees or taxes.   You will pay for what you use, as you use it. $5 is deducted from your balance every 30 days.  Your 30 day cycle is based on the time that you signed up.  If you don’t have sufficient balance in your account you will be notified and placed into a 14 day grace period.   After the grace period is complete your account will be terminated and your phone number will be lost.

Airtime is a charge per minute for all phone calls made without the Boss Revolution app.  In other words, when calling with your Phone’s dialpad or contacts.   Airtime calls that connect are billed from the time that ringing starts.  Calls that don’t connect are not billed.  All calls made using the Boss Revolution mobile app are billed from the time of the connection.  There is no Airtime charge when dialing through the app. Use the Boss Revolution app to save on all of your calls.

All calls you receive including voicemail will use Airtime.

Data is billed in Megabyte increments.  In order to give you the best data experience, when you begin a data session we deduct enough balance to allow your data to stream continuously. When your data session ends whatever amount is unused gets returned to your balance.  That is why you sometimes will see your balance fluctuate slightly up or down, sometimes even after you have just recharged your account.  With Boss Revolution Mobile you will never pay for data that you don’t use.
