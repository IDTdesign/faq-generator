If you are already a Boss Revolution Mobile customer and you want to switch to a new device, log into your account and use the Swap Device feature in your account center.  Just like when you signed up for our service make sure that before you start the Device Swap you have located the phoneâ€™s MEID and ICCID.  Both of these numbers can be found on the box your phone came in.
